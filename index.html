<h2> Who am I? </h2>
<p> 
  My name is Nicol√≤ and I currently work at <a href="https://spanflug.de/" target="_blank">Spanflug</a> on really cool topics, mostly related to computer vision.
  Not long ago, I was a graduate student at University of Milan, in the department of computer science! 
  <br>
  I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Optimization and Computer Science. I'm probably even more interested in music, but that's a different story..
