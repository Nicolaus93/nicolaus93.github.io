Listening to random music today on Spotify, I encountered this:

but the music sounded familiar. And indeed at the end of the song you can hear "vieni qui, vieni qui.." -> EUREKA! I immediately recognized Mina,

I was even more surprised when I found out that the song from Navy Blue was not the only one to use a sample from "I Discorsi". You can hear it also in this song

Btw, MNDSGN is great - I really like this track and its arrangements (bass line is wow) from him:

Anyway, random music from Spotify kept going and I stumbled upon another track

I REALLY want to know what is the song sampled here, I spent quite some time looking (well more hearing) around but couldn't find anything.. Please HEEEELP!
