I noticed that the [link](https://air.unimi.it/retrieve/handle/2434/823932/1733635/phd_unimi_R12065.pdf) pointing to my phd thesis hosted on my University website is currently broken. 
I had the final version uploaded to overleaf. Unfortunately, overleaf seems to have introduced some limitations on the project size for the free version. So I just downloaded the files and recompiled the thesis with latexmk. 

Anyway, the thesis explores several aspects of online convex optimization, including:

- Online Mirror Descent and its theoretical foundations
- Implicit updates and their applications in dynamic environments
- Parameter-free algorithms and adaptivity
- Learning with expert advice
